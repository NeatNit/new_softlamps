Types of HeavyLight modules:

1. Multipliers - modules that change something in the world or something in the camera view before each render. Examples: soft lamps, Super DOF
2. Blender - sets the render target, calls the renderer and takes care of blending the results. Examples: Default (with anti-aliasing), Floating-Point Texture (with better HDR), or each of the above with additive blending.
3. Renderer/Render Multiplier - modules that render the scene, possibly in a nonstandard way. Examples: soft lamps godrays, good old RenderView.
